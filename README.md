### Project overview
---
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales perfomance of the E-commerce project over the past year. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources
The primary source of data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle, FRED, or any other data repository site. 

### Tools Used

    3. for Data Visualization

- SQL - Structured Query Language for quering of data

EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as‚ùî
